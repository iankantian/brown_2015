Ethan Brown's "Learning JavaScript" with ES6 focus

I wanted to go from zero to competent with ECMAScript 2015.

To further the cause of adoption of ES6, consider buying a copy for yourself: http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920035534.do
To get it even faster: http://www.amazon.com/Learning-JavaScript-Essentials-Application-Development/dp/1491914912  for the low-carbon approach, consider an e-reader download!
